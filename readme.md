## Project Description
This project is created for a laboratory assignment of the class Introduction to Software Engineering - Spring 2022 (CSE4214/6214). In this project, we develop a Facebook-like social media web platform. This project aims to develop and design so that users can easily and intuitively use the following functions on the platform.

- Account creation, edit, deletion
- See the timelines of the own user and others
- Sign-in/Sign-out
- Composite, edit, delete posts
- Sending friend requests and accepting/rejecting friend requests
- Removing friends from Friends List
- Writing comments, like/dislike button, sharing posts

Languages will be used for platform development are ReactJs, CSS, and HTML, and we will use Firebase for DB construction.
